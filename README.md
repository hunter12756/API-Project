My project is a clone of the popular site Meetup with a twist on it! Meetup is dedicated to helping people create and foster communities
of people that enjoy similar interests and activities as each other. So I created Game Up which is similar to Meetup, but specifically for Gamers! You can create a group about a certain Genre or specific game and recruit members to join! Host events like tournaments, hangouts, coaching sessions, helping new players, and more!
